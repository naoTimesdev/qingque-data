Some deceptive businesspeople even named the species \"Destructive Mega Lizard,\" hoping to sell it to newbie Annihilation Gang members for a high price on the black market.

These Nameless, trapped in the underground passage, discovered an edible algae species and held on until help arrived thanks to consuming this algae. That was how these delectable algae were introduced to the stars — when people realized that these algae were nothing less than the Kolchis, this moss ball became labeled as an invasive species on more than fifty planets.","tag":""},"6510":{"id":6510,"name":"First Journey","icon":"icon/rogue/curios/1092.png","desc":"Lightning characters' Weakness Break Efficiency increases by 30%.
